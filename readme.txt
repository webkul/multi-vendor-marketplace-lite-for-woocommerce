= Privacy notices =

To show top billing countries and charts on the seller's Dashboard this plugin uses Google Map Services. Thus, confirming the provider's privacy policy is recommended.

* Google Map and Charts ([Google](https://policies.google.com/?hl=en))

For showing extensions and the support and services menu we are using our Webkul Services. So, confirming the privacy policies is recommended.

* Extensions ([Webkul Policy](https://webkul.com/privacy-policy/))

Multi-Vendor Marketplace Lite for WooCommerce &#8211; Create Your Amazing B2C Multi-Vendor Marketplace Intuitively uses [Appsero](https://appsero.com) SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user's confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Appsero SDK **does not gather any data by default.** The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data **when a user allows it via the admin notice**. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users.

Integrating Appsero SDK **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, **without confirmation from users in any case.**

Learn more about how [Appsero collects and uses this data](https://appsero.com/privacy-policy/).
